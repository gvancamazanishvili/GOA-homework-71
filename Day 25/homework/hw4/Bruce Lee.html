        <h3><em style="color:#343131;"> Bruce Lee</em></h3>

        <p style="color:#A04747 ;">Bruce Lee (born Lee Jun-fan, 1940–1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist, actor, and filmmaker, and the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy blending various combat styles with Zen and Taoist thought.

        He is widely recognized as the first global Chinese film star and one of the most influential martial artists in cinema history. His films—such as The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, The Way of the Dragon, and Enter the Dragon—helped popularize martial arts worldwide and brought international attention to Hong Kong action cinema.

        Bruce Lee trained in Wing Chun under Ip Man, as well as boxing, tai chi, and street fighting. He moved to the U.S. in 1959, studied at the University of Washington, and opened martial arts schools in Seattle and Oakland. His students included Chuck Norris and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

        He died suddenly in 1973 at age 32, but his legacy lives on in combat sports, film, and popular culture. TIME Magazine named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.</p>
